Deep reinforcement learning has actractted many works in robotics. This post introduces some of them for robotics.

1. DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)

DDPG is a combination between DQN (Deep-Q Network) and DPG (Deep Policy Gradient). First, we introduce DQN 

2. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
