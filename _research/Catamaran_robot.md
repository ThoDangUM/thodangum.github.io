Enegery optimization plays an important role for a long trip (especially occean tasks). A solar kite will be a good solution for long-endurance surface vehicles. 

This project proposed an optimal path planning method for a Catamaran. The catamaran was equiped with solar pannel (like a kite) which can produce energy. An A*-based algorithm was used to find an optimal path which miminizes energy consumption (propulsion,...) and maximizes energy production thanks to sun's direction and wind parameters.
